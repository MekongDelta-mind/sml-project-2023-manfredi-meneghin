#### DATA ANALYSIS ####
#######################

'''
The visualisation of the feature distribution showed that:
- dep_delay contains a small amount of outliers
- there are considerably less flight on a saturday (this might mean that on saturday there is less delay)
- during the winter months (from November to Febraury) the number of flight is 25% less than the rest of the months. No significant peaks.
- the flight time have two different peaks at 8am and 17pm. There are very few flights before 6am and after 21pm.
- almost the entirety of flights depart from Terminal 5 (this might influence, as not, the flight delay)
- the temperature is bivariate and very few times goes below -15Â°
- visibility has two peaks, around 50km and 80km. However, there are no outliners.
- the bin date pressure (binned from 970 and 1060 in 8 buckets), is fairly a normal distribution.
- humidity, considered in percentages, from 30% to 100%, is usally high.
- gusts_wind and wind_speed have very few times high values, but their values are still acceptable (2*IQR rule)
- the number of flights within 60min is a uniform function, with a peak in 14 and a maximum in 36
- total_cloud is not representative of any other cloud measurement, however all the cloud measurement have one or two peaks in the interval extremes
- the most present are low_cloud, followed by medium_cloud and high_cloud in last position
- most of the features are loosely correlated with the delay
- out of outlier cases, the weather does not influence the delay. The highest impacting are the visibility and the wind_speed
